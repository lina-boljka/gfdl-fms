Forcing module
==============
This directory contains changes to the Held and Suarez (1994) forcing scheme, including
an implementation of the Polvani and Kushner (2002) scheme.
Note that throughout the model, this module is refered to as `hs_forcing`.
Decided it's not really worth refactoring everything to use e.g. `pk` for Polvani and Kushner.
