<H4>OVERVIEW</H4>
<!-- BEGIN OVERVIEW -->
<PRE>

     Initializes a data structure containing constants
     for a hybrid sigma-pressure vertical coordinate.
     There are several public routines that operate with
     this data structure.

<A NAME="DESCRIPTION">
<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION -->
<PRE>
     This module uses the hybrid sigma-pressure vertical coordidate
     described in Simmons and Burridge (1981).  At the model's
     lower boundary the coordinate surfaces must be in the
     terrian-following, sigma coordinate. The model's upper levels
     may use constant pressure surfaces. In between there is a
     gradual transition from sigma to pressure. A transition that
     is too rapid can result in negative pressure depths for model
     layers with low surface pressure.

     Pressure p is determined by the following formula:

            p(k) = peta(k) + eta(k) * pssl

     where   (k) = the vertical index
             peta = reference pressure
             eta  = sigma/eta values (between 0. and 1.)
             pssl = ps * res
             ps   = surface pressure
             res  = 1./eta_surface (=1 for non-eta case)

             peta, eta      are dimensioned only in the vertical
             pssl, ps, res  are dimensioned only in the horizontal


     NOTE:  The B-grid dynamical core has an unsupported option that
            replaces the sigma coordinate with the eta/step-mountain
            vertical coordinate.  In the context of this module,
            references to "sigma" and "eta" are interchangeable.
