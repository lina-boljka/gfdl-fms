<h2>2 &nbsp; Time differencing</h2>

<p>The B-grid core uses a split time differencing scheme.
   There are 3 time steps that are used. The shortest time step for gravity waves
   is called the <i>adjustment time step</i>. Advection and horizontal mixing terms 
   are solved on the <i>advection time step</i>. The physical forcing, diagnostics,
   and the calculation of updated prognostic variables is done on the <i>atmospheric time step</i>.
   This figure depicts the relationship between these time steps.</p>
<img src="time_steps.jpg">
   
<p>The advection and adjustment time steps are set as multiples of the atmospheric
    time step. The following namelist variables are used to set the time steps.</p>
<pre>
 &amp;main_nml  dt_atmos = 1800 /
 &amp;bgrid_core_driver_nml  num_adjust_dt = 3,  num_advec_dt  = 3 /
</pre>
<p>For this example the atmospheric, advection, and adjustment time steps would
   be 1800, 600, and 300 seconds, respectively. These are typical time steps
   used with a resolution of 144 longitudes by 90 latitudes. 
   <i>A model with this resolution is also referred to as a N45 model since there
       are 45 latitudes rows between the equator and pole.</i></p>

<p>Here is a flow chart for the B-grid dynamical core.
   The center boxes represent terms that are solved on the adjustment time step.
   Terms in the right column are applied on the advection time. The left column
   is computed on the atmospheric time step.<br>

<h2>3 &nbsp; Data</h2>

<h3>3.1 &nbsp; Data structures</h3>

<p>The B-grid core makes extensive use of data structures (Fortran 90 derived-types).
   The data structures group related data and greatly reduce the number of arguments
   passed between Fortran subroutines.  Unless specifically stated, the data defined
   within a data structure is public (it may be directly accessed).
   The data structures names defined in the B-grid core all end with <i>_type</i>.
   All data structures are initialized by calling a constructor routine and may
   be terminated by calling a destructor routine (if it exists).

<p>Here is a summary of important data structures defined in the B-grid core.

<dl>
<dt><a href="../tools/bgrid_horiz.html#DATA_TYPES"><b><tt>horiz_grid_type</tt></b></a>
<dd>horizontal grid constants for all sub-grids
    <br>defined by module bgrid_horiz_mod

<dd>Contains the 3d step-mountain topography masks
    and 2d indexing for the lowest model level
    <br>defined by module bgrid_masks_mod

<dt><a href="../tools/bgrid_prog_var.html#DATA_TYPES"><b><tt>prog_var_type</tt></b></a>
<dd>Contains horizontal and vertical grid indices, 
    and the prognostic variables for
    surface pressure, momentum, temperature, and tracers
    <br>defined by module bgrid_prog_var_mod

<dt><a href="../tools/bgrid_polar_filter.html#DATA_TYPES"><b><tt>pfilt_control_type</tt></b></a>
<dd>Contains constants needed by the polar filtering interfaces.
    The contents of this structure are private.

<dt><a href="../model/bgrid_core.html#DATA_TYPES"><b><tt>bgrid_dynam_type</tt></b></a>
<dd>Contains grid constants, time step information, and other pre-computed terms
    that are needed by the dynamical core.  This includes other data 
    structures and pointers to the physical data, but does not include
    the prognostic variables.
    <br>defined by module bgrid_core_mod

</dl>

<h3>3.2 &nbsp; Memory Allocation</h3>
<p> Memory for the B-grid dynamical core is <i>dynamically</i> allocated at run time
    (as opposed to fixing the memory requirements prior to compilation).
    The memory required is determined from the model resolution in the initial condition
    restart file. When the restart file does not exist the model will try to
    create a simple initial condition (a flow at rest). In this case, the model resolution
    is read from the cold start namelist (<a href="../tools/bgrid_cold_start.f90#NAMELIST">bgrid_cold_start_nml</a>).
    The model fails if neither the B-grid restart file or the cold start resolution
    have been provided.</p> 

<h3>3.3 &nbsp; Data Sets</h3>
<p>A limited number of input files are required when running the solo dynamical core.
   The following (input) files and directories must be present in the directory
   where you are running the model.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b><tt>input.nml</tt></b>
<dd>A collection of all the namelist records needed by the model.
    This includes namelists for the main program, infrastructure, 
    and atmospheric physics (if applicable). Since most (if not all)
    namelist variables have default values it is not necessary to have
    all namelist records in this file.

<dt><b><tt>diag_table</tt></b>
<dd>Table of diagnostic fields that will be written periodically to NetCDF files.
    Refer to documentation on the <a href="../../shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.html">diagnostics manager</a>
    for more details.

<dt><b><tt>field_table</tt></b>
<dd>Table of declared tracers and what options will be applied to each tracer.
    Refer to documentation on the <a href="../../shared/field_manager/field_manager.html">field</a>
    and <a href="../../shared/tracer_manager/tracer_manager.html">tracer managers</a> for more details.

<dt>Sub-directories: <b><tt>INPUT</tt></b> and <b><tt>RESTART</tt></b><br>
<dd>The INPUT sub-directory may contain the input restart files 
    (otherwise a cold start is attempted). The RESTART sub-directory is where
    the model will write the output restart files.
</dl>

<p>If you are running full atmospheric model (with physics) a large number of
   input files will be required. These files will reside in the <b><tt>INPUT</tt></b>
   sub-directory.</p>

<h3>3.4 &nbsp; Restart files</h3>

<p>Restart files may be written as NetCDF files or as NATIVE files (using unformatted Fortran writes).
A namelist switch controls which output format is used, the default is NATIVE format.
The switch is set with the following variable:</p>
<pre>
 &amp;bgrid_core_driver_nml    restart_output_format = 'netcdf'  /
 &amp;bgrid_core_driver_nml    restart_output_format = 'native'  /
</pre>
<p>When the NetCDF output option is used it is recommended that a single fileset
be used to write the restart files. This option is set with the following namelist variable:</p>
<pre>
 &amp;fms_io_nml  threading_write = 'single', fileset_write = 'single'/
</pre>
<p>For input restart files the model can read either the NetCDF or NATIVE format.
   The model will look for both file types, there is no need to set a namelist variable.</p>

<p>NetCDF restart files are written using simplified metadata. 
   For example, indices are used for axis data and there are no meaningful attributes.
   All variables are defined with 4 dimensions (dim_1,dim_2,dim_3,time).
   A one-dimensional field only uses the first dimension (dim_1) and sets the
   size of the other dimensions to one. 
   All variables are written as double (64-bit) precision.</p>

<p>For a model resolution of 144 longitudes x 90 latitudes x 20 levels,
   the following axes and variables might be defined in the restart file
   called <i>RESTART/bgrid_prog_var.res.nc</i>.</p>
<pre>

       xaxis_1 = 21 ;
       xaxis_2 = 144 ;
       yaxis_1 = 1 ;
       yaxis_2 = 90 ;
       yaxis_3 = 89 ;

<h2>4 &nbsp; The horizontal grid</h2>

<h3>4.1 &nbsp; The global grid</h3>

<p>For all model grids, array indexing increases from west to east, south to north,
   and top to bottom.</p>

<p>The global temperature grid is aligned so that grid box edges line up with
   the equator and the poles. For a global grid with 144 x 90 points, the west and south edges
   of the first grid box start at 0&deg; (longitude) and 90&deg;S.
   The last grid box has east and north edges at 0&deg; (longitude) and 90&deg;N.
   The following figure depicts key features of a global temperature grid with this resolution.</p>
 <img src="global_temp_grid.jpg">

<p>The global velocity grid is shifted by one-half of a grid box to the north and east
     of a temperature grid box. The global velocity grid has one less latitude row
     than the global temperature grid.
     For a global grid with 144 x 89 points, the west and south edges of the first grid box start at
     1.25&deg;E and 89&deg;S. The last grid box has east and north edges at 1.25&deg;E and 89&deg;N.
     The latitude rows that would be centered at the poles are not considered part
     of the computation domain.
     The following figure depicts key features of a global velocity grid at this resolution.</p>
 <img src="global_vel_grid.jpg">

<h3>4.1 &nbsp; Domain decomposition</h3>

<p>Domain decomposition (or layout) for multiple processor jobs is done in the X-Y (longitude-latitude) plane.
   The following namelist variable specifies that the global grid be decomposed 3 times
   along the X-axis and 2 times along the Y-axis (6 processors must be used).
<pre>
 &amp;bgrid_core_driver_nml    layout = 3,2  /
</pre>
   More information about how to specify the domain layout can be found in the 
   <a href="../model/bgrid_core_driver.html#NAMELIST">online namelist documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The following figure depicts the domain decomposition and displays some of the terminology.</p>
 <img src="decomposition.jpg">
<p>The <i>compute</i> domain and <i>data</i> domain are defined locally on each processor.
   The compute domain is the computational grid where valid model results are computed.
   The data domain is the compute domain plus additional rows and columns
   to assist in horizontal differencing. The B-grid core uses only <b>one</b> halo row.
   Higher order differencing is accomplished by doing additional <i>halo updates</i>.</p>

<h3>4.2 &nbsp; Polar row indexing</h3>

<p>As previous stated, the global velocity grid has one less latitude row 
   than the temperature grid. To simplify array structures the B-grid core allocates
   the same size arrays for both temperature and velocity fields. 
   As a result the northernmost latitude row in the velocity grid is not used.</p>

<p>The alignment of the temperature and velocity grids in the vicinity of the south pole
   is relatively straightforward. The velocity grid cell with the same <i>i,j</i> indices
   is located to the northeast of a temperature cell. The halo row for the velocity grid
   is located on the pole with the velocity set to zero. </p>
 <img src="south_pole.jpg">

<p>Here is the same figure for the north pole. Note that the northernmost latitude row
   in the velocity grid is not used.</p>
