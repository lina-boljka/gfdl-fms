# GFDL dry core modifications

See the file [doc.pdf](https://github.com/lukelbd/gfdl-drycore/master/blob/doc.pdf) for more information.

Namelist parameters for the modified forcing scheme are specified in the `&forcing_nml` namelist; a sample can be found in the file [`forcing_default.nml`](https://github.com/lukelbd/gfdl-drycore/blob/master/forcing_default.nml).

# Model Documentation
## Model levels
The Polvani and Kushner method for constructing levels with high stratospheric resolution has been implemented directly, and can be requested using `vert_coord_option='pk_sigma'` (analagous to `vert_coord_option='even_sigma'`) in the `&spectral_dynamics_nml` namelist (see below).

Alternatively, I've copied various hybrid coordinate configurations used by ECMWF products, found in the `levels` directory. These can be copied into a `&vert_coordinate_nml` namelist entry as shown in `levels_era.nml` (which employs the 60-level ERA-Interim configuration), and applied using `vert_coord_option='input'` in the `&spectral_dynamics_nml` namelist (see below).

Note the ERA-Interim archive was produced with the Cy31r1 model release, i.e. 91 levels with T255 truncation. A table of truncation numbers, resulting (recommended) number of latitudes, and the parallelization restrictions is shown below.

| Truncation | Number of latitudes | Recommended number of cores (latitudes per file) |
| ---        | ---    |  ---       |
| 42 | 64 | 16 (4) |
| 63 | 96 | 24 (4) |
| 85 | 128 | 32 (4) |
| 106 | 160 | 40 (4) |
| 159 | 240 | 60 (4) |
| 170 | 256 | 64 (4) |
| 266 | | 400 | 100 (4) |

## Diagnostic table `diag_table`
Note that **comments** in `diag_table` (lines starting with `#`) can only come after the header lines, and cannot interrupt "sections". Also note that **strings** must be in double quotes.

### Header lines

  1. Experiment title
  1. Base date for netCDF output; default is `0000-00-00 00:00:00`)

### Ouput file line (6 comma-separated values)

  1. File name string
  1. Output frequency, one of the following:
  * \>`0`: output frequency in units `"units"`
  * `0`: output at every timestep
  * `-1`: output at the end of run
  1. Output frequency units: use one of `"years"`, `"months"`, `"days"`, `"minutes"`, `"hours"`, `"seconds"`
  1. Format: use `1` for NetCDF (the **only** supported format... not sure why it has a column)
  1. Time axis units: units for time axis on output NetCDF; use one of `"days"`, `"minutes"`, `"hours"`, `"seconds"`
  1. Time axis name: name for time axis on output NetCDF, default `"time"`

### Diagnostic field line (8 comma-separated values)

  1. Module name that can export this parameter name (e.g. `"dynamics"` or `"forcing"`)
  1. Fortran module parameter name 
  1. Parameter name for NetCDF file
  1. File name string
  1. Time sampling for taking averages: currently, only support averaging over *all* time steps of model run
  1. Whether we take time average, one of `.true.` or `.false.` -- for `.true.`, the file output frequency should be `-1`
  1. Other options: not implemented... use the dummy string `"none"`
  1. Packing value: `1` = double or 64-bit, `2` = float or 32-bit (best for most applications), `4` = 16-bit integer

### `&forcing_nml`

Note for all damping parameters, a positive value means seconds, negative means days, and zero means off (no damping). To apply damping to mean and anomaly components separately, make sure `ndamp_decomp` and/or `rdamp_decomp` are set to `.true.`, and specify in the namelist e.g. `ktrop = -40, 0` to set the mean and anomaly components, respectively (this syntax indicates you are passing a length-2 array).

### `&fms_nml`

| Parameter | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `domains_stack_size` | 8000000 | Necessary value varies for different model resolutions, domain decompositions, and number of processors used. Quote from documentation: "If you increase the model resolution or are running on a small number of processors, you may get the error message `MPP_UPDATE_DOMAINS user stack overflow`. In this case, increase the domain stack size found in the core-specific namelist files. The new stack size should be greater than or equal to the number printed in the error message." |
