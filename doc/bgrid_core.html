<H4>OVERVIEW</H4>
<!-- BEGIN OVERVIEW -->
<PRE>

     The top-level module for the B-grid atmospheric dynamical core.
     This module controls many of the time integration options while
     calling other modules to compute individual terms.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="DESCRIPTION">
<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION -->
<PRE>
     The B-grid dynamical core updates the tendencies of the 
     prognostic variables, the variables themselves are not modified.
     The prognostic variables are surface pressure, the zonal and 
     meridional momentum components, temperature, and optionally an
     arbitrary number of tracers. The core recognizes the tracer 
     specific humidity (sphum) when computing virtual temperature.

     This version of the B-grid dynamics use a two time level scheme
     with time splitting.  The gravity waves are integrated using a
     forward-backward scheme with a relatively short time step and
     the advection terms are integrated with a longer time step.
     Horizontal diffusion is done on the advective time step.

     The B-grid core uses data structures (derived-type variables)
     to group similar data and passes these data structures between
     subroutines.  Data structures for the horizontal and vertical
     constants must be initialized before initializing the B-grid core.
     The initialization routine returns a data structure that is needed
     by subsequent calls when updating the prognostic variables tendencies.
     The prognostic variables are also contained as a data structure.

     Here is a detailed write-up of the finite differencing used in the
     <A HREF="bgrid_core.tech.ps">B-grid atmospheric dynamical core</A>.

                        polar filter response function.
                        SS(new) = SS(std)**filter_weight,
                        where SS(std) is the Arakawa and Lamb response function.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: filter_weight = 1 ]</FONT>

   ref_lat_filter       The reference latitude at which polar filtering

                        Setting this argument &gt;= 90. will turn off
                        polar filtering.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[real, default: ref_lat_filter = 60.]</FONT>

   ddamp_coeff          Coefficient for divergence damping.

                        is averaged over all adjustment time steps.  If avg_omega=FALSE
                        then the value of omega for the last adjustment step is returned.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[logical, default: avg_omega = FALSE]</FONT>

                        Currently, this option is not being used.
                          <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: verbose = 0]</FONT>


NOTES

    fis and res should be dimension by the size of the global grid,
    the number of longitude points by number of latitude points.
    <b>The declaration of fis and res must have the target attribute
    and the storage must be static.</b>

  ----------------------------
  The B-grid model can be run with either "sigma" (terrain following)
  coordinates or "eta" (the step-mountain coordinate).  In the sigma
  coordinate system, the coordinate surfaces follow the topography,
  there is always the same number of model levels above ground at all
  grid boxes.  In the eta coordinate system, the coordinate surfaces
  are nearly horizontal, model grid boxes will be beneath the topography.
  The step-mountain topography can be thought of as "building blocks".
  The model levels below the topography are masked out.
